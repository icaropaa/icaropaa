Hi! I'm Icaro, welcome to my GitHub :wave:
---------------------------------
### About me

:briefcase: I'm a Software Engineer and Government Auditor at Brazil's Supreme Audit Institute (TCU). At TCU, I combine technical and auditing skills to improve government spending, such as developing internal systems to support work or analyzing data. Some stacks used are Python, SQL, Oracle Apex, and Power FX.

:mortar_board: I'm also pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.



In my public repositories you will find a description of some projects I have worked on. Due to intelectual property rights of Georgia Tech and of my current and past employers, I cannot share code in those repositories.
